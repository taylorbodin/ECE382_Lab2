===========

An XOR decryption program

## Objectives and Purpose

Write a program that can decrypt an XOR encrypted string given the cipher text and key. Emphasis will be placed on utilizing
sub routines for this lab. I will have to also need to practice call-by-value and call-by-reference in this exercise. 

## Implementation Plan
